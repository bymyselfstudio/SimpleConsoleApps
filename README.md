Nothing special here. It's just my learning space.
Whenever one starts to learn programming, things have to be understood in an easy way.
So here's my first attempts to get ideas to work. 
The more I know solutions will get smarter :)

Most of my codes might be improved, but to understand where the magic happens I oftenly
build my own logic and try to get things work in that order. Later I optimize them to 
match performance issues or to improve the readability.
